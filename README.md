# Aragona_Nature_2020
The following codes were used for clonal analysis in Aragona et al. (Nature, 2020).

Fortran codes used in modeling analysis of clonal fate data.

Analysis of ctrl system for one progenitor model: ctrl_1prog.f   
Analysis of ctrl system for two progenitor model: ctrl_2prog.f   
Analysis of TPA treated system: tpa_2prog.f   
Analysis of expand system: exp_2prog.f   
Analysis of tram treatment in expand conditions: tram_2prog.f   
Analysis of srf treatment in expand condition: srf_2prog.f   

Source data containing raw clone size distributions:   
ctrldist.dat   
tpadist.dat   
expdist.dat   
tramdist.dat   
srfdist.dat   

Details of the model can be found in Supplementary Note. Details of the operation of the code are provided as comments in the fortran files.
